In this paper we investigate the potential of nonlinear posteriors within the graph-cut optimization framework. We propose to reformulate the data energy in the energy function considering not only a single pixel but also its neighborhood, not only color information but also texture features, and utilizing posterior class probability learnt by a classifier to enhance the discrimination between foreground and background, where the color information only is less discriminative.
