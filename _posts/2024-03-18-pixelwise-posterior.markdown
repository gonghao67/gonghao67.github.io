In this paper we investigate the potential of nonlinear posteriors within the graph-cut optimization framework. By Existing
graph cuts based segmentation methods sharper the extrema of cost function likelihood distributions of intensity or color
information a prior information levet-set, We propose a graphcut based image segmentation method by posterior probability.
