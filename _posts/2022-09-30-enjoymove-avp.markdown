Led the development of a new SLAM technique to build semantic visual map for self-localization feature in AVP application, using inputs from CNN-based semantic detection of road markings and IMU-wheel encoder coupled odometry. As vehicle maneuvers, the map evolves in form of a dynamic semantic graph comprising semantic attributes and odometry. Graph optimization then periodically minimizes pose errors of semantic objects and egomotion, updating both local and global mapping. Once complete, vehicle re-localization can be effectively achieved in familiar environments, providing accurate pose estimations that guides vehicle navigation, path planning and control towards designated parking spots.
This L4 autonomous driving feature capable of executing parking maneuvers up to 1000m with high precision in pose prediction (rotational error &le; 1Â°, translational error &le; 20cm). Sensor configuration: Ultrasonic Sensors (USS) x12, AVM Camera x4, F-Camera x1, IMU x1, and 4D MMW Radar x1.
